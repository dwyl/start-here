## Gmail

If you don't already have one, create a Gmail (Google) Account

> https://accounts.google.com/signup

### Why?

Your email address says a lot about you.

or http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10605176/What-does-your-email-address-say-about-you.html

Gmail is the best ("free") email service (we are aware of).
They take security seriously and have *many* great features
(like search, filters and threaded messages).

### Tip for Choosing a Gmail Address
Hundreds of millions of people have gmail accounts
(most simply to use the Google/Android Play Store)
as a result it can be hard to get your name as your gmail address.
e.g. Andrew.Smith@gmail.com is taken. So, consider adding an initial

Make sure you use a ***strong*** password. If someone can guess (or "crack")
your password they will gain access to *everything* else. not good... :hankey:


## Twitter

~~While~~ having a twitter account is ~~not~~ essential, it helps you
to stay up to date with news/updates in your chosen field. https://twitter.com/

Even if you don't become a Twitter "Power User", its good to follow
what's going on in your the world of web/app development.

### Choosing a good Twitter "Handle"

> "All of the *good* names are taken..."

Not true.

Sure, *many* short, single word or personal names are taken,
but there are still *plenty* of two-word or "_invented_" names
you can pick from. *Get creative* with keeping your handle as short as possible.
while making it easy to remember/type.

### Follow

Decide what you want to be good at (_known for_) and _follow_ all
the people who are already doing (_good_) work in that area.

Follow people you know in "real world" so you can keep in touch.

### Favourite :heart:

*Favourite* the tweets you find useful/interesting/insightful/informative,
this serves multiple purposes:  
(a) bookmark content so you can return to it later.  
(b) the author of the tweet/content knows it was useful so they will make more!
(c) your followers can see what you find like-worthy.

### Re-Tweet :recycle:

If you think a post someone has shared is good re-tweet it!
This has *many* positive effects:  
(a) the person who posted the content will
get *positive reenforcement* (*i.e. they will make more content*),
(b) the content author might follow you back (*if they don't already*)  
(c) if you consistently re-tweet useful content you will become known
for relevance in that area and more people will follow/re-tweet you!

## GitHub

Github.com is where people share the projects/code they are working on,
discover what others are building and collaborate on cool things!

There are other _alternatives_ for sharing code in a team,
but GitHub has become the gathering place for the Open Source community.

### Register

If you don't already have a GitHub account, [get one today](https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference#how-to-sign-up)!
(_try and match the username to the one you picked on Twitter for consistency_)

> https://github.com/

### Complete Your Profile

Add some detail to your profile so you are less "_generic_".

Especially the new "bio" section which lets you link
to various places and add a bit of text describing yourself.

#### Gravatar

GitHub (and other services) use Gravatar to manage your **avatar image**.

> https://gravatar.com

### Follow People!

If you find someone _interesting_ on GitHub, follow them!

> You can spot a non-coder (*or ex-coder*) a mile away by how _few_
people they follow on GitHub.

### Star Projects!

Star the repositories (project) you find _interesting/promising_,
both so you can return to them later and to _encourage_ the
authors to _continue_ in their quest!

### Contribute!

The easiest way to contribute to a project/repository is to read through
the documentation (`README.md`) and if you _spot an improvement_, _**create an issue**_!


### Set Up SSH Keys for GitHub

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "edwardcodes@gmail.com"

#### New to Command Line?

Do not be intimidated by the command line.
Asking a computer to perform tasks by typing words instead of
clicking on buttons.  
If you are *completely* new to using the Command Line <br /> watch:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP0b0iaZiWk (Git For The Intimidated) <br />
and: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4 (The Basics of Git and GitHub)

## StackOverflow / StackExchange

StackOverflow is where technology people ask & answer questions.
Create an account and explore.

> https://stackoverflow.com/users/signup

Once you have registered, try _answering_ people's questions:
http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=interesting

When you get stuck on _anything_

_Asking_ and _Answering_ questions on StackOverflow is an _easy_
way of demonstrating your knowledge.

> If you have trouble getting your first few points on "SO", don't worry
you aren't alone, get in touch and we will give you some pointers.

# *Optional* (*Recommended*)

## Trello

Even though we use GitHub to manage our issue backlog, Trello is widely used by developers.
It is one of the easiest, most versatile (and "**free**") project/task
tracking tools. Take the tour, register and try it!

Use your Google account to sign up.

> https://trello.com/tour

## Linux

Most people use Windows but every developer should know how to use a **Linux OS**. There are dozens of Linux versions but the most suggested for beginners is _Ubuntu._ It's free and open source.
>https://www.ubuntu.com

## Quora

More *subjective* (opinion-based) than StackOverflow, Quora lets
you ask *specific* people in the industry a question.

Again, use your gmail to register/sign-in

## JQuery

While we don't tend to use JQuery for *new* projects @dwyl
(see: http://youmightnotneedjquery.com ),
JQuery is still used on 65% of websites, so if you ever have
to work on an _existing_ project, you will almost _inevitably_
come across it.
