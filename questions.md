Welcome to @dwyl! We are _stoked_ you found us! üîç > ‚ù§Ô∏è > üéâ

In order to get to know each other better,
we are each going to answer a few questions.

Some of these questions will fell _very_ "_personal_".
The answers are yours to keep and reflect on, be honest with _yourself_.

The questions are _meant_ to make you _think_.
Write down the _first_ thing that comes into your mind,
your _first_ thought is usually the most accurate reflection
of what you are truly feeling.

It should take you one "pomodoro" (_25 minutes_) to write your answers.
Don't spend more than a few minutes on each question
otherwise you are "_over-thinking_" it.
The point is not to write an "essay" for each answer,
just a few sentences is more than "enough".

There are no "right" or "wrong" answers,
these are _your_ answers,
they are "_right_" for _you_
at this point in your life.


These are _personal_ questions we will be asking all our future
"_core_" team members. It's ~~important~~ _essential_ to have answers.

@dwyl We don't believe in having _formal interviews_
with "_brainteaser_" questions like <br />
"How Many [Things] Are There in [Location]?" <br />
e.g: "How many yoga teachers are there in the USA?" <br />
or "How many taxi drivers are there in New York City?" <br />
These types of questions have their place and are useful
deductive reasoning exercises.
They are insightful for understanding _how_ people think
and systematically approach challenges they haven't encountered before.
But they have limited relevance to understanding _why_ people think
a certain way or _what_ people think about most often.
We are _way_ more interested in people's
answers to the "_Why?_" questions than _how_
they implement a particular algorithm on a whiteboard.
We feel that knowing _who_ you are as a _person_
is the most important thing in a working and friendship relationship.

With that in mind here are the 20 "intro" questions:
(_the first question is "logistical"
and helps us improve our efforts to find like-minded people. Thanks!_)


## 0. _How_ did you discover dwyl?

```sh
# I discovered dwyl:






```

> **Meta**: we love knowing how, where, when and why people discover dwyl.
It helps us know works in spreading our mission.


## 1. _Why_ are you here?

```sh
# the *reason* I am here today is:





```

> **Meta**: this is for _you_ to understand your _own_
motives for being here.


## 2. Is there _anywhere_ you would _rather_ be or _anything_ you would prefer to be doing _right now_?

Is there a ***place*** you would rather be,
***person*** you would prefer to be with,
or ***activity*** you would rather be doing?


```sh
# I would rather be ...




```

### 2.a If you would rather be somewhere `else`, _why_ is that?


```sh
# I would rather be ... *because*:




```

> **Meta**: the purpose of this question is for you to _understand_
what your **priority** is *long-term* so you can ensure to focus on it.
i.e. "DWYL: Don't Waste Your Life!"


## 3. Is there a "significant person" (_or people_) in your life?

```sh
# The list of most significant people in my life:






```

> **Meta**: understanding who the most important people in your life are,
is _essential_ for knowing what to/not focus on.


## 4. Who is the person (or list of people) that most encourages you to keep improving?

Who is the person in who most encourages you to keep improving in life?
(_the person can be "in" your life or "out" of your life, alive or deceased._)
If you have a _list_ of people
list them in any order and then number them later.

```sh
# the list of (one or more) people who most encourage me to keep improving is:




```


## 5. Do you feel you have a _personal_ "_mission_" in life?

If you do, write it down.
If you _don't_ feel that you have a _personal_ mission,
write down a mission that you most _identify_ with.

```sh
# my personal life mission (or a mission I strongly identify with) is:






```

> **Meta**: the purpose of this exercise is to help you discover
if you are _already_ pursuing a _mission_ in your life.
If not, that's perfectly fine!
It's just good to get a "snapshot" of your thinking.




## 6. If you could work on any _challenge/problem_, what would it be?

If you could dedicate your time to solving a particular challenge/problem
however big or small, personal or "world", what would it be?

```sh
# I would most like to spend my time solving the following challenge:







```

> **Meta**: the purpose of this exercise is to help you discover
if you are _already_ pursuing a _mission_ in your life.
If not, that's perfectly fine!
It's just good to get a "snapshot" of your thinking.





## 7. If you won the lottery, what would you spend your life/time doing?

If you had a "mega millions" windfall of $100M (USD)
and never had to _think_ about money _ever_ again,
what would you spend your time doing?
List as many things as you can think of.


```sh
# If I won the lottery, I would spend my time doing:








```

> **Meta**: This question might sound "clich√©",
but it's surprisingly insightful
as a "proxy" for what you find meaningful in life.
If you didn't have to work for money,
and had "enough" cash in the bank to do _anything_ with your life,
what would you do? Would you spend your life travelling?
Start a family with your significant other? Solve a specific world problem?
Again, there no "wrong" or "right" answers!
Just write what you feel/think you would do.





### 7.a Are you already doing any of the things you listed above?

Are you _already_ doing anything of the things you listed above?


```sh
# List the things you love doing, which you already do:








```

> **Meta**: This question might sound "clich√©",
but it's surprisingly insightful



## 8. Do you believe the statement: "_you only live once_"?

This is not about "_religion_" or "_faith_",
it's a matter of _understanding_ how you approach life.


```sh
# I feel that life ...






```

## 9. What is the most _valuable_ lesson you have learned in life?

What is a lesson you have learned in life "_the **hard** way_"
that you wish you had known earlier?
Your answer can be in _any_ aspect of your personal or professional life.
As a guide, the thing you would tell your younger self if you could that
would have the _most_ impact on their life.

```sh
# my most valuable life lesson is:





```

## 10. What was the most difficult decision or challenge you have faced?

Describe an instance where you had to make a decision
or faced a challenge
that was particularly difficult.

```sh
# my most difficult decision or challenge was:





```

> **Meta**: coping with _extreme_ difficulty
is character building and sharing
_how_ you handle difficult decisions or challenges
is insightful for yourself and others.

is not where ~~he~~ they stand~~s~~
in moments of comfort and convenience,
but where ~~he~~ they stand~~s~~
at times of challenge and controversy_."
~ Martin Luther King, Jr.

-->


## 11. Have you ever failed to take advantage of an _amazing_ one-time opportunity?

Have you ever failed to make the most of an _amazing_ once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, that you later regretted?

```sh
# the most amazing opportunity I missed out on was:





```

> **Meta**: this is not a question about "retrospective" opportunity spotting,
like "BitCoin" or "Buying Amazon Shares".
It's about a chance to go somewhere or do something that was a one off
thing that you wish you could go back and take with both hands.
This is insightful because if you have never missed an amazing chance,
you won't know how to spot it when a "Golden Ticket" is offered to you.
Again, there is no "wrong" answer here and it will depend a lot
on what stage in life you are at.

## 12. What have you made a conscious choice to say 'no' to even though it was a great opportunity; and why?

Saying "no" to _superficially_ great opportunities can be one of the most difficult things in life,
give an example of where you have made this decision conciously and explain why if possible:

```sh
# I have said 'no' to:





```

> **Meta**: Saying 'no' is hard, even to things you _don't_ want to do, but it's
even harder to say no to things that you really want to say 'yes' to.
This is about helping you recognise that ***everything you say 'yes' to
has an opportunity cost*** and to think more critically about whether you need
to be saying 'no' more in future.

## 13. Is there a person you used to be close to who you no longer speak to? _Why_?

You don't need to write the name of the person, just write down the _reason_
why you are no longer in contact with the person.
If you don't have an example for this question, count yourself lucky!

```sh
# The reason the relationship "broke down" was:





```


> **Meta**: this is useful for you to know _why_ and/or _how_
you have been _hurt_ in the past,
if you have "scars" how do you deal with them.
Was it _all_ the other person's "fault",
what would you have done differently in hindsight?
Learning from people is _way_ more important than technical skills,
people can make-or-break organisations or your _life_
far more destructively and unpredictably than a "bug" in the code.
How you _deal_ with that is _far_ more insightful
than how you solve "bubble-sort".


### 13.a What would cause you to "cut out" someone from your life?

If you did not have an answer for `#13`
or if you have a criteria that would be grounds for an "instant elimination",
what would that be:

```sh
# My list of reasons why I would no longer speak to someone:





```

> **Meta**: if you are the type of person who always forgives people;
that is admirable; You have achieved a "higher state".
Most people have a "line" that if someone crosses,
they will no longer be "welcome" in their lives.
If you have such a "line", what is it?
The _reason_ this question is relevant is to understand
what ethics/morals/standards people hold
without going a deep philosophical discussion.


## 14. "_What important truth do very few people agree with you on?_"


```sh
# An important truth, few people agree with is:





```

## 15. When and where did you heard first time of the the word *open source software* ? 

share your early memories about OSS. 
Share everything how you came to know about FOSS and also if you want can share about your expeirience, did you liked this idea?
Did you feel intrigued that you too want to contribute.

```sh
# I heard of about open source software when:






```

This leads neatly into what we are building in "Phase One" ...
